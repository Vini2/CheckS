# CheckS: Checking the presence of a species in a metagenomics sample with known taxonomic composition

CheckS is a pipeline to check the presence of a species in NGS data (reads and assembled contigs) of a metagenomics sample, provided its reference genome and the reference genomes of the other known species. 

CheckS carries out four analysis steps to determine the presence of a query reference genome as follows.

1. K-mer analysis
2. Coverage analysis
3. Assembly analysis
4. Gene analysis
